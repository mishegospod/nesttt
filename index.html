                    <p>We assume you’ve already thought about this, but it never hurts to mention it again: anyone getting a dog should be aware that man's best friend takes up a lot of time and needs attention, education, guidance and love. 
                        The dog will become part of your everyday life - for more than a decade.
                         You will be completely responsible for a living being that depends on you in many ways.
                         After all, the little rascal can't exactly prepare his own food or just hop on the toilet for a moment.</p>

                        <p>As romantic as the idea of a dog is, it’s also clear that a dog costs money. 
                            In addition to regular costs for food and care, there are also vet’s bills - not only in case of illness, but also, for example, 
                            for recurring vaccinations to protect against infectious diseases or regular deworming. Further costs arise from the dog tax (see point 7) and liability insurance (see point 8). 
                            You should definitely expect to pay between €100 and €200 per month.</p>
